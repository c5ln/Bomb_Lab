# Bomb_Lab

A "binary bomb" is a Linux executable C program that consists of six
"phases." Each phase expects the student to enter a particular string
on stdin.  If the student enters the expected string, then that phase
is "defused."  Otherwise the bomb "explodes" by printing "BOOM!!!".
The goal for the students is to defuse as many phases as possible.
